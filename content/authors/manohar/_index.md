Manohar Mulchandani consults and assists organizations to help them harness the potential of data. He has successfully helped clients build and deploy Machine Learning models in production, and assisted them with the attendant Digital Transformation. 

In his previous avatar, he lead teams in successfully executing and deploying business critical IT projects to global clients in different industries.

He hopes to use his IT experience and his knowledge of the data science eco-system to make programming and data science  accessible to everyone. To that end, he has made a modest beginning by creating online courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org). The initial courses are aimed at making programming more accessible and these courses can be found under the **My Courses** tab.
